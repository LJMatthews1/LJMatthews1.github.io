										<b>Project Type:</b> MVP Development <br>
										<b>Duration:</b> 10 weeks <br>
										<b>Position:</b> Project Design and Development Engineering Intern<br>
										<b>Time:</b> Summer 2025<br>
										As the design and development engineer my task was to create the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the company to push to market. The product itself was a new type of a robotic gripper that could interact with and pick up objects that are difficult for traditional grippers to pick up, such as suction or parallel. The final product had to be food safe as it can be used in numerous industries but specifically the agricultural industry. <br>

										The goal of the project was to design, build and test an RC ship model and then demonstrate its operation in a water tank. Collecting a specified amount of surface level waste within a target time was the end goal. My job within the team was to manage the team and to design the general boat architecture alongside the collection system. <br>
										The module was based on The Ocean Cleanup projects.
</p>
									<h2>End Result</h2>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Industry/Gripper/TWGCResult.png" alt="" /></span>
									By the end of the project, I was able to manufacture a robust system that landed the TWGC’s first large customer in the agricultural industry.<br>

									I not only learned about how to design a product in an industrial setting whilst considering the economic viability, but also, I learned how to communicate  and demonstrate design  elements that were easy for the customers to understand the inherent value of the product. <br>

									I also had the privilege to work with KUKA and UR3 robots where I used Python through ROS to control the gripper and the robots’ movements in tandem.
